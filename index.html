<p>I would say analyzing comes naturally to me. I analyze anything before making any decision right from what kind of food do I buy to where should I invest my money. When I started learning data science, I wanted to put it in practice. Practice makes a man perfect, doesn't it? So I decided to do a project on my own and 'what to do?' was my biggest question. I wanted to do something where I can learn and at the same time bring out a measurable result that could help others. That's when I got thinking....</p>

<p>When I moved to bay area back in 2013, I was looking for an apartment in San Francisco Bay Area to rent for a family of two. My husband and me had many factors to consider. We wanted to be close to his office to avoid long commute, near to grocery stores, near to public transportation and of course REASONABLE price. After much of research and analysis I found the perfect apartment for us! Spacious, 2 miles from his office, half mile from shopping centre, walkable to Caltrain station and most importantly 'cheaper' than the apartments in Mountain View! Now we have a family of three and we are back at that point again and thats when I decided to perform Real-Estate Data (RED)analysis!</p>

<p>My plan is to</p>

<ul>
<li>Scrap data from various websites which offer a platform for property managers/owners to advertise their property for rent on real time, </li>
<li>Study market dynamics, </li>
<li>Create Visualizations, </li>
<li>Apply machine learning, </li>
<li>Build an app that will predict rent in future and current best property according to users' preferences.</li>
</ul>

<p>So far, I have been able to perform web scraping and you can check out my repository at my github account. Next post will follow soon and I will talk about my journey into web scraping!</p>
